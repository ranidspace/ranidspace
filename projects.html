          <h2>Blender BFRES Importer</h2>
        </a>
        I was fed up of spending ages ripping 3D models from Switch Toolbox and then importing them into blender and it
        would often be bad and require a lot of extra work, so I was fed up and just made a Blender Importer for BFRES
        files.

          <h2>Splatoon 3 Gear Completion Checker</h2>
        </a>
        My first attempt at javascript in web design to make an easy to use web app to check all of the gear you own in
        the video game splatoon 3. Well the app is easy to use it's just getting the file to upload there. I also
        attempted to make the site look good on mobile as well! So check it out on your phone.

            <h2>splatoongamefiles</h2>
          </a>
          A blog I ran where I would rip files from Splatoon (wild). Eventually turned into a more general splatoon
          blog. I'm hoping to
          make a site where I can upload easily searchable model files, similar to VG resource but just for splatoon
          stuff.

            Basically just my letterboxd profile. It took a long ass time to compile this so I'm counting it as a
            project. I also dont have enough projects to put here.
            Not all of these have reviews or even ratings. I am generally bad at rating things.
