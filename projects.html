        My first attempt at javascript in web design to make an easy to use web app to check all of the gear you own in the video game splatoon 3. Well the app is easy to use 
        it's just getting the file to upload there. I also attempted to make the site look good on mobile as well! So check it out on your phone.

          Basically just my letterboxd profile. It took a long ass time to compile this so I'm counting it as a project. I also dont have enough projects to put here.
          Not all of these have reviews or even ratings. I am generally bad at rating things.
