Most games didn't have \"DLC Updates\" either, but I'd check just to\nmake sure.\n\nThe dump will create a lot of nested folders, `/NCA FS/User/Extracted/[Game\nInfo]/[Data or Program] #0/[Some Number]` but inside that numbered folder that\nis the actual files you'd want.\n\n#### Method 2: Using an NSP file.\n\nYou can also follow the guide in \"Proceed to Dumping to PC\", which will give you\nan NSP file.\n\nI believe switch toolbox can actually open up an NSP or an XCI file directly,\nhowever it's a bit more convenient to dump the files.\n\nYou can load up the NSP into an\n[emulator](https://www.androidauthority.com/nintendo-emulators-legal-3517187/).\nThe last builds of Yuzu and Ryujinx are archived around, and there are forks\ngoing around. Make sure it's trustworthy, look around on Reddit, idfk.\n\nI do prefer Ryujinx, but it can't dump DLCs. So Yuzu has to do. Once a game\nis in Yuzu (don't start the game) right click on it, hit `Dump RomFS` (twice)\nand when it's done it will show you where it extracted.\n\n#### Notes\n\nHere's the final dump of the Update for Splatoon 3 looks like.\n\n![A list of folders, with names such as \"Model\", \"Effect\", \"Mals\", \"Sound\" and\n\"Layout\"](/images/blog/gamefiles/romfsfolders.png)\n\nYou can also, instead of dumping romfs, dump exefs, which has the game code.\nYou'd have to decompile it to make sense of it though. Don't ask me how, I don't\nknow, it's very scary.\n\nIn both methods the dumped files are in odd locations, and you can move them\nhowever you want, I would keep the DLC files in separate folders. Here's my file\nstructure\n\n![A folder structure, Inside Splatoon 3 there is \"base\", \"inkopolis\", and \"side\norder\", and inside side order there are the files from the previous\nimage](/images/blog/gamefiles/layout.png)\n\n## Models and Textures\n\nIf you're going to be putting models into blender, I made a [Blender\nadd-on](https://github.com/ranidspace/BlenderBfresImporter) to import bfres\nmodels directly. From there, you can export it to whichever format you like.\n\nI still think it's a good idea to learn Switch Toolbox, it's good for a lot more\nthan just bfres files, and is more useful in a lot of ways.\n\nSwitch Toolbox is technically archived, however work is still being put into it\nhere and there, so I would [download the latest\nbuild](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox/releases/tag/Latest)\nfrom the Github.\n\nI have also made [my own fork](https://github.com/ranidspace/Switch-Toolbox)\nwhich just has some small changes which I prefer, but also fixes for previewing\nSplatoon 3 models. You will have to build it yourself. I wont go into that here,\nbut the regular Switch Toolbox works completely fine.\n\nOnce you have it open, you can just open the folder with the romfs, and browse\naround.\n\nI'll be talking about things from Splatoon here, but other games may have\nsimilar structures.\n\n#### Model Basics\n\nModels are in the `Model` folder. Double click on anything to see it in the 3D\nview.\n\n![A screenshot of Switch Toolbox, The highlighted item on the left is\nNPC_Knickknacks, and in the viewport, harmony from Splatoon is there. There's a\nlot of visual noise and some things are the wrong\ncolour](/images/blog/gamefiles/before.png)\n\nThe yellow octahedrons are animations bones. You can make them smaller or turn\nthem off in Settings -> Main Settings -> Display Bones. You can also see that\nparts of her are just completely black, and this can be fixed in the same\nsettings menu by turning off \"Display Vertex Colors,\" but other models may need\nit to look proper.\n\n![The same screenshot, with the issues mentioned\nfixed](/images/blog/gamefiles/after.png)\n\n#### Texture Basics\n\nEvery model has a textures folder, and you can view them in a big viewer but\nclicking the little 3D button at the top, otherwise it goes into a small preview\nin the bottom right\n\n![A screenshot showing a full view of a normal map\ntexture](/images/blog/gamefiles/channelswapon.png)\n\nIf you've dealt with normal maps before this may look odd, as normal maps are\nusually a blue colour. You may also notice that some other textures like\nroughness or ambient occlusion textures are transparent when they shouldn't be.\nThis can be fixed by turning off `View -> Use Component Selector`\n\n![A similar screenshot, showing the menu to turn off the option. The normal map\nnow is blue](/images/blog/gamefiles/channelswapoff.png)\n\nSome games will need this option ON however, just check to see which one looks\nlike it makes more sense.\n\n#### Exporting\n\nAnd now for the moment you've all been waiting for, if you open the \"Models\"\nfolder, you can click Export, and it will save the model as a DAE.\n\n![A screenshot with a context menu over a file in the Models folder of the\nmodel, highlighting \"Export\"](/images/blog/gamefiles/exportmodels.png)\n\nThis will also export the included textures, though I would actually recommend\nagainst exporting the textures like this. When exporting the model, turn off\n\"Export textures.\" Afterwards, right click on the \"Textures\" folder, and click\n\"Export All Textures.\"\n\n![A screenshot with a context menu over the Textures folder, highlighting\n\"Export All Textures\"](/images/blog/gamefiles/exporttextures.png)\n\nThis will avoid textures with the same name from other\nmodels being included instead, as well as including all the unused textures\n(some models have variants of textures for things like eyes, it will only export\nthe first one otherwise).\n\nIf the textures worked better with the \"Component Selector\" off, disable the\n\"Use Texture Channel Swaps\" option.\n\n![The options for exporting a texture. \"Use Texture Channel Swaps\" is\nunchecked](/images/blog/gamefiles/textureoptions.png)\n\nIf possible, I would suggest using `Microsoft DDS (.dds)` textures as the \"bntx\"\nformat that the textures are originally in use the exact same compression\nmethods so you get the smallest size with no loss in quality. Otherwise png is\ngood and more easily usable.\n\n#### Batch Model Extraction\n\nThere can be multiple models inside of each \"Model.\" You can export all at once\nusing `Tools -> Batch Export Models`. You can do this for as many different\nfiles at a time. Once again I would recommend turning off texture exporting, and\ndoing it separately, with `Tools -> Batch Export Textures (All Supported\nFormats)`. This also is much faster for some reason.\n\n#### Using the models\n\nIf the .dae and the textures are in the same folder, you should be able to open\nit in any software that supports it. I would recommend converting it to an FBX\nfirst. Blender for instance has a much better FBX importer, while the DAE\nimporter is in the process of being removed. The creator of FBX has [their own\nconverter](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/fbx-converter-archives)\nbut no libraries or any sort of open documentation for it so this is\nwhat we get instead of being able to directly export to it, lovely.\n\n#### Other stuff here\n\nAnything UI related is either in the \"Layout\" or \"UI\" folders. Layout archives\ncontain all the info about what textures go where on the screen, how things are\n\"laid out.\" The support for Splatoon 3 layout files aren't too great, I think\nthe developer is working on a Layout Library, so check up on that once in a\nwhile.\n\nParticles are in the \"Effect\" folder, however toolbox will not work if you try\nto open them. The file is compressed, so you can use Tools -> Compression ->\nZSTD -> Decompress, or just open it in 7zip and decompress it with that. Once\nyou have that you can open it in a hex editor, find \"VFXB\" and delete everything\nthat comes before it. Save the file, rename the extension to .ptcl, and Toolbox\nshould be able to open it. It's crude but what can you do.\n\n## Text\n\nThe text is in the \"Mals\" folder, anything from dialogue to UI text, it should\nall be in there. For Splatoon 3 they are in \"sarc\" files, but those can be\nopened with switch toolbox. Inside you'll see a lot of \"msbt\" files, and while\nswitch toolbox can open them, other tools do the job better, such as [MSBT\nEditor](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/releases). You'll probably\nhave to export the files first.\n\nI've not personally used it, as for Splatoon 3, [LeanYoshi dumps all the text\nout every\nupdate](https://github.com/Leanny/splat3/blob/main/data/language/USen_full_unicode.json),\nalong with a lot of other neat stuff, if you go looking around that Github.\n\n## Sound Effects and Music\n\nYou're gonna need [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) along with the\n[vgmstream component for it](https://vgmstream.org/).\n\nAfter you install that, you should just be able to play anything in\n`Sound/Resource/Stream` folder. For Splatoon 3 this has all the music, and a\ncouple ambient sound effects. The rest of the sound effects are in the\n\"Resource\" folder, all as .bars.zs files. BARS files are packs of bfwavs, so you\ncan use a tool like [BARSReaderGUI](https://github.com/natv1337/BARSReaderGUI)\nto extract them all into folders.\n\nSome things will cause it to crash, usually if something inside of the BARS file\nis also in the \"Stream\" folder, it will set the length of the file to -1 and the\nprogram doesn't know how to handle that. I [forked\nit](https://github.com/ranidspace/BARSReaderGUI) to deal with this properly,\nwhen batch extracting, just exporting an empty file if it encounters it, but\nonce again, you have to build it yourself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRipping models yourself is a really good skill to know, Switch Toolbox tells you\na LOT about the model that you can't just get from a ripped model. What colours\ncertain things are, exactly what values certain things have, etc.\n\nThere's a lot of demand for ripped assets and like barely a handful of people\nwho are doing it, I just think this could help out a bunch for everyone if even\na few more people started doing it.\n\nThe only reason I started splatoongamefiles was just because I noticed nobody\nelse did it, and I found it fun.

I would recommend converting it to an FBX\nfirst. Blender for instance has a much better FBX importer, while the DAE\nimporter is in the process of being removed. The creator of FBX has \u003Ca href=\"https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/fbx-converter-archives\">their own\nconverter\u003C/a>\nbut no libraries or any sort of open documentation for it so this is\nwhat we get instead of being able to directly export to it, lovely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"other-stuff-here\">Other stuff here\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Anything UI related is either in the “Layout” or “UI” folders. Layout archives\ncontain all the info about what textures go where on the screen, how things are\n“laid out.” The support for Splatoon 3 layout files aren’t too great, I think\nthe developer is working on a Layout Library, so check up on that once in a\nwhile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Particles are in the “Effect” folder, however toolbox will not work if you try\nto open them. The file is compressed, so you can use Tools -> Compression ->\nZSTD -> Decompress, or just open it in 7zip and decompress it with that. Once\nyou have that you can open it in a hex editor, find “VFXB” and delete everything\nthat comes before it. Save the file, rename the extension to .ptcl, and Toolbox\nshould be able to open it. It’s crude but what can you do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"text\">Text\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The text is in the “Mals” folder, anything from dialogue to UI text, it should\nall be in there. For Splatoon 3 they are in “sarc” files, but those can be\nopened with switch toolbox. Inside you’ll see a lot of “msbt” files, and while\nswitch toolbox can open them, other tools do the job better, such as \u003Ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/releases\">MSBT\nEditor\u003C/a>. You’ll probably\nhave to export the files first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve not personally used it, as for Splatoon 3, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Leanny/splat3/blob/main/data/language/USen_full_unicode.json\">LeanYoshi dumps all the text\nout every\nupdate\u003C/a>,\nalong with a lot of other neat stuff, if you go looking around that Github.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"sound-effects-and-music\">Sound Effects and Music\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>You’re gonna need \u003Ca href=\"https://www.foobar2000.org/\">foobar2000\u003C/a> along with the\n\u003Ca href=\"https://vgmstream.org/\">vgmstream component for it\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After you install that, you should just be able to play anything in\n\u003Ccode>Sound/Resource/Stream\u003C/code> folder. For Splatoon 3 this has all the music, and a\ncouple ambient sound effects. The rest of the sound effects are in the\n“Resource” folder, all as .bars.zs files. BARS files are packs of bfwavs, so you\ncan use a tool like \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/natv1337/BARSReaderGUI\">BARSReaderGUI\u003C/a>\nto extract them all into folders.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some things will cause it to crash, usually if something inside of the BARS file\nis also in the “Stream” folder, it will set the length of the file to -1 and the\nprogram doesn’t know how to handle that. I \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/ranidspace/BARSReaderGUI\">forked\nit\u003C/a> to deal with this properly,\nwhen batch extracting, just exporting an empty file if it encounters it, but\nonce again, you have to build it yourself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ripping models yourself is a really good skill to know, Switch Toolbox tells you\na LOT about the model that you can’t just get from a ripped model. What colours\ncertain things are, exactly what values certain things have, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There’s a lot of demand for ripped assets and like barely a handful of people\nwho are doing it, I just think this could help out a bunch for everyone if even\na few more people started doing it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The only reason I started splatoongamefiles was just because I noticed nobody\nelse did it, and I found it fun.
