I have moved this site from doing everything manually to a content management
system, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which means making blog posts and
updating everything every time I want to add something new a lot easier. This
is honestly really cool lol.

You can also now see that there's links to each post on in the title! So you can
permalink to it. There's currently no "Blog" page, as the main page just is it,
but idk maybe I'll do that at some point.

The Atom feed is also now generated automatically and thank god. Note that the
IDs and stuff have all been messed around. So if for some reason you had my RSS
feed on (please tell me if you do I'm so curious) I would just delete it and add
it again to avoid any more weirdness, but it should be fine from now on.

This also means I can blog more! Like actual blogging whoa lol.

Um. I've started writing quite a bit! I've been inspired a lot lately so idfk
look out for fanfics coming soon near you. I'm not adding it to my projects page
you have to venture and find them yourself sorry \</3
