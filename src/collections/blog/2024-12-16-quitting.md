I feel like every time I go on tumblr or bluesky or whatever shit everyone's
complaining how everything sucks. I don't feel like anything is worth it like I
wake up and spend an hour scrolling shit and then by the end of it who cares.
I'm tired.

I'm hoping to spend more time working on this website and I encourage everyone
to make their own websites and bookmark a bunch of other personal sites as well.
I'm hoping to get into making an RSS feed so if u wanna you can just see these
posts, but I don't really plan on doing too much with this.

Anyway thats all bye
