I've decided to make a bit of a blog here in order to fill up this first page.
So here's what I use when im on my computer.

I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/). It is one of the
only browsers that is not based on chromium. Google owns chromium and is
cracking down on ad blockers and such, and firefox is much more customizable in
my experience. Moving from chrome to Firefox was pretty easy and there's not
much that I miss.

If you care about privacy (which you should), I suggest use these two
extensions:
[Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/),
[LocalCDN](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/).

<small>Edit as of 2024-01-02: <br /> Turns out that LocalCDN is ALSO not
needed, and is covered by Ublock origin. i've been wanting to put this here for
a while but i only did it now.</small>

This list was actually a lot longer. I then later found out that a bunch of
extensions I used were reduntant or very old. LocalCDN is just a fork of
Decentraleyes, which is a lot more updated, Privacy badger and DuckDuckGo
Privacy essentials is redundant with blocking trackers with Ublock origin.
HTTPS everywhere is just built into Firefox these days, it's this thing:

![A screenshot with text, a title saying 'HTTPS-Only Mode' and a paragraph of
text which reads 'HTTPS provides a secure, encrypted connection between Firefox
and the websites you visit. Most websites support HTTPS, and if HTTPS-Only Mode
is enabled, then Firefox will upgrade all connections to HTTPS.'

Firefox in general can be
[hardened for privacy](https://brainfucksec.github.io/firefox-hardening-guide)
but there's a lot of stuff that can break functionality and slow things down.
Don't do everything on that page blindly, learn what they do first.

Moving on from Firefox, rapid firing some open source programs I use which was
originally the fucking point of this blog post:
[7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (please stop using winrar),
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)
(Use version 3.0.2! It's the latest version without telemetry),
[Droid-ify](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.looker.droidify/),
[Authenticator Pro](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/me.jmh.authenticatorpro)
(the repository should be included in Droid-ify),
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and a lot more stuff but thats the stuff i use daily

I would also like to take a moment to recommend
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Stop using the same password on every site.
This is basic security

Anyway, most people I know already know this stuff, I really just made this in
order to get something interesting on this page. Happy surfing.
